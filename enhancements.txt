Possible enhancements
1. [Learning curve: medium] Use command line args to take filename input
2. Add validation and reject lines that do seem to be USN, eg: 000ABCDEGH (same length but not a usn) or 1RV15 (length mismatch) etc
3. More edge cases? Does empty file give proper outputs? why or why not?
